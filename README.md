## Features

### Package management

**What**: A detailed list of project dependencies, showcasing installable versions, the latest updates, changelogs, and
additional package information.

**Why**: Efficient package management is vital for maintaining a healthy codebase. By keeping packages up-to-date, it
helps in avoiding potential conflicts, deprecated methods, and security vulnerabilities. The inclusion of changelogs and
package info further assists in making informed decisions, ensuring that the chosen packages align well with the
project's requirements.

### Project structure

**What**: A comprehensive visualization offering an overview of all the files, classes, and declarations
within your Dart and Flutter project.

**Why**: By presenting a clear layout of every file and class, developers can gain a deeper understanding of the
architecture and design.

### String literals

**What**: An exhaustive list of all the string values used throughout the project.

**Why**: Managing and locating strings becomes a cinch with this feature. For developers aiming to implement
internationalization (i18n) or just striving for consistency in messaging and labeling, having a consolidated view of
all string literals is invaluable. It simplifies the process of making content changes, aids in the detection of
hard-coded values that might be better served in a configuration or language file, and ensures that redundant or
repetitive strings can be spotted and managed with ease.
